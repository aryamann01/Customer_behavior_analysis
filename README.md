📊 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

A data analytics project exploring customer shopping patterns using Python, SQL (PostgreSQL), Power BI, and a final presentation/report.

📝 Overview

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to uncover patterns in spending, product preferences, demographics, and purchasing frequency.
The objective is to transform raw transactional data into actionable insights using end-to-end data analytics techniques—data loading, cleaning, EDA, SQL analysis, dashboard building, and storytelling through a report and presentation.

📁 Dataset

The dataset includes customer transactions with fields such as:

Customer ID

Gender / Age

Product Category

Purchase Amount

Payment Method

Shopping Frequency

Subscription Status

The data is provided as a CSV file and used across Python, SQL, and Power BI for analysis.

🔍 Project Steps
1. Data Loading (Python)

Imported CSV data in Jupyter Notebook

Inspected structure, columns, and data types

Handled missing values and basic transformations

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics

Distribution plots

Trend analysis

Customer segmentation (age groups, gender, categories)

3. Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates

Formatted columns

Handled nulls

Standardized categorical fields

Created new derived variables where needed

4. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)
